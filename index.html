		<h2>I'm a dedicated Squarespace developer</h2>
		<P>Being that I've based my business off of the Squarespace platform, there's nothing I can't handle. Below you'll find a selection of some of my most recent Squarespace projects that showcase the type of clients I work closely with.Red Russak manages to use minimal information, yet provides enough detail about himself. A single glance at his website remains etched into the mind. He proceeds to provide the reader with ways to reach him. His website is a simple yet convincing one. As his expertise lies in the finance industry, Benjamin's portfolio does not have lots of information. However, he has managed to stay ahead of his competitors by updating his blog regularly with relevant information. Callie's website includes comprehensive information covering each of her accomplishments. She gathers every source where users can find her features across the internet.</P>
